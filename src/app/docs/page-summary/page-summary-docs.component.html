        You can use the <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux/components/toolbar">toolbar component</a> to display actions in a SKY UX-themed toolbar in the page summary. We recommend that you include only actions that relate to the page as a whole and that you exclude actions that are specific to the tiles on the page. Limit the number of actions in the toolbar. If the page summary requires many actions, re-examine the tasks and consider alternative workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Display the toolbar below the page summary. Place frequently used actions directly in the toolbar, and place less-frequently used actions in a more actions menu. Actions to collapse and expand all tiles on the record are docked on the right side of the toolbar.
